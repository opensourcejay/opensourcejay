# 👋 Hey, I'm Jay

I'm a builder, problem solver, and tech creative focused on making complex things simple and fun to work with.

🧠 I share real-world projects and walkthroughs on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@imjustablknerd) to help devs learn by building. Whether it's web apps, AI tools, or creative experiments, I break it down in a way that makes sense.
